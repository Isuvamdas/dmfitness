                "The journey from being just another gym-goer to standing on competitive stages has been transformative both physically and mentally. My first competition at Haldia Gold Classic taught me what it truly takes to be competitive, and those lessons were instrumental in achieving 4th place at Bangabir 2025. I couldn't have made this progress without the expert guidance, constant motivation, and scientific approach from my coaches. This is just the beginning of my competitive journey."

            <h3>Nutrition Strategy</h3>
            <p>Rohan's nutrition was periodized to support each phase of his transformation:</p>

                <li><strong>Building Phase:</strong> Strategic caloric surplus with nutrient timing</li>
                <li><strong>First Competition Cutting Phase:</strong> Calculated deficit with basic carb manipulation</li>
